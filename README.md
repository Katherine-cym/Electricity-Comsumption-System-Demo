## Introduction

The MVP demonstrates how household electricity consumption can be tracked, processed, and visualized.  
It is designed with an in-memory infrastructure to simulate the flow of electricity meter data, account management, and daily aggregation.

Demo:
- We **simulate meter readings** by generating_CSV_files_with_meter_reading.py.  
- We use **Shiny** to build the dashboard where users can check and compare their usage.  

- **Core Focus:** Meter Data Management  
- **Simulated Components:** Account registration, Account login, Visualize meter readings at fixed intervals
